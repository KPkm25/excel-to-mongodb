# Excel Upload App


This web application allows users to upload Excel files (.xlsx, .csv) to a MongoDB database. It utilizes Node.js, Express, Multer, XLSX, and MongoDB for the backend, and EJS for server-side templating. The application provides a simple interface for users to select an Excel file, which is then processed and its data stored in a MongoDB database.
## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KPkm25/excel-to-mongodb
cd excel-to-mongodb
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root directory and set your MongoDB connection URI:
```bash
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_uri
PORT=3000
```
Start the server:
```bash
npm run test
```
The server will run on 
```bash

```
## Usage
